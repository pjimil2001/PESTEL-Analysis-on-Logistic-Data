ðŸ“¦ Global Logistics Data Analysis (2015â€“2018)
This Power BI-driven project analyzes a global logistics dataset containing 16K orders and $3.12M in sales between 2015 and 2018. The goal is to uncover operational inefficiencies, regional trends, and strategic opportunities using both descriptive analytics and the PESTEL framework.

ðŸ“ˆ Project Highlights
Total Orders: 16,000

Total Sales: $3.12M

Average Profit/Order: $22.60

Avg. Sales/Customer (Europe): $179.89

Delayed Deliveries: 57.73%

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Components
A. Operational Overview
Monthly Orders: Seasonal spikes in July (+22%) due to summer demand; drops in December due to holiday shutdowns.

Geographic Distribution: Orders concentrated in Europe, North America, and Asia.

Delivery Timeliness:

Early: 22.80%

On-Time: 19.47%

Delayed: 57.73%

B. Political Analysis
Regulatory Fines: 40% from U.S. and Mexico due to customs delays.

Government Stability Map: Highlights political risk in parts of Africa and Asia.

Trade Regulation Impact:

Low-regulation regions â†’ Higher profit per order

High-regulation â†’ More delays

C. Economic Analysis
Inflation: Peaked in 2016 (5.53%), lowered by 2018.

Currency Exchange Impact:

Higher rates correlate with slight profit increases

1.35+ exchange zones yield 18% higher margins

D. Social Factors
Sales per Customer:

Europe highest

Africa lowest

Urbanization: Consistent (~72%) across segments

Consumer Preferences: Stable/rising/declining preferences all contribute ~5.2K orders â†’ dynamic demand

E. Technological Factors
AI/Automation: Limited impact on order quantity so far

Internet Penetration: ~75% across shipping modes â†’ supports digital tracking

F. Environmental Insights
Carbon Footprint: Avg. score = 110.38; no clear link to profit

Eco-Friendly Packaging: 50% compliance â†’ room for ESG improvement

G. Legal Considerations
Fine Distribution: Several small countries contribute to regulatory fines ($388.65M total)

Labor Law Compliance: High compliance leads to highest total profit ($346.33K)

ðŸ“Œ Strategic Recommendations
Optimize Delivery in Africa: Partner with local carriers to reduce 57% delays by 20% using geospatial data.

Regulatory Compliance (Mexico): Allocate $200K/year to legal teams â†’ projected 30% fine reduction in 12 months.

Boost AI ROI: Pilot automation in corporate segments with predictive inventory tools (Visual 14).

Sustainability Push: Improve eco-packaging and reduce carbon impact for long-term ESG performance.

ðŸ§  Conclusion
This project reveals how logistics inefficiencies, like delivery delays, result in ~$1.2M/year lost in repeat business. Europeâ€™s high purchasing power supports premium tiers, while data-driven targeting (e.g., local partnerships in Africa, compliance investment in Mexico) offers measurable ROI over generic tech adoption.
